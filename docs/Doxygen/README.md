# Documentation

VASim provides a Doxygen Doxyfile for automatic documentation generation. To generate the HTML and LaTeX documentation, install doxygen and run the following command in the VASim/docs/ directory:

```bash
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```

A version for the development trunk of VASim is [hosted here](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jpw8bd/vasim_docs/).
